# Colmar-academy
This is a final study project done on the “Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages” course by Codecademy.

I was tasked with designing and creating the landing page for a new school specified by the wireframes.
Working on this project allowed me to demonstrate all the skills developed on the course (building HTML layouts, styling with CSS and using Git, Github, and deploying my project using Github pages).
